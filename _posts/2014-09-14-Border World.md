## Introduction:
A light theme with a menu layout reminisent of some zenfor themes.  This still uses the standard superfish menu
js as the standard ElkArte theme but in nav style.  More squared corners than standard Elk.  Has a slider quick login
bar and a expanding search menu to snaz things up a bit.

## Installation:
{% include install_std.MD %}
